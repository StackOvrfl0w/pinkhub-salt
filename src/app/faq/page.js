      question: "What is your Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)?",
      answer:
        "For wholesale orders, our MOQ typically starts at 500kg or one pallet, depending on the product type. For private label projects, we recommend a minimum of 1000 units to ensure cost-effectiveness for packaging customization.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer international shipping?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we ship globally. We handle all logistics, including freight booking and export documentation. We can ship FCL (Full Container Load) or LCL (Less than Container Load) to any major port worldwide.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get samples before placing a bulk order?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We encourage clients to test our quality. We offer sample kits. While the samples are often free, the client is responsible for covering the courier/shipping charges.",
    },
    {
      question: "What certifications does your salt have?",
      answer:
        "Our Himalayan Salt is processed in ISO 9001:2015 and HACCP certified facilities. We also provide Certificate of Analysis (COA) and Origin Certificates with every shipment to guarantee purity and authenticity.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide Private Label / OEM services?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this is our specialty. We can customize packaging (pouches, grinders, jars, boxes) with your brand's logo and design. Our design team can also assist in creating the artwork if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your payment terms?",
      answer:
        "For international orders, we typically require a 50% advance deposit via T/T (Bank Transfer) to start production, with the remaining balance due against the copy of the Bill of Lading (B/L). LC (Letter of Credit) is available for large container orders.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does production take?",
      answer:
        "Standard production time is 15-20 days for a 20ft container. Custom packaging or private label orders may take slightly longer (25-30 days) depending on the complexity of the packaging design.",
